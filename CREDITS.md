## Swiss Ephemeris (via `pyswisseph`)

- Planetary positions and house cusps.
- © Astrodienst AG, Zürich — <https://www.astro.com/swisseph/>
- **License: GNU AGPL v3** (or a commercial license from Astrodienst).
  Because this engine links Swiss Ephemeris, the whole project is distributed
  under **AGPL-3.0** (see `LICENSE`). If you deploy it as a network service,
  AGPL §13 requires you to offer the complete corresponding source to the users
  of that service. For a closed-source / commercial deployment, obtain a
  Swiss Ephemeris **commercial license** from Astrodienst instead.
- This build uses the **Moshier** analytical ephemeris (`swe.FLG_MOSEPH`): no
  external `.se1` data files are required, but minor bodies (e.g. Chiron) are
  not available.
